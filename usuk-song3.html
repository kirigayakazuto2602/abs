  <h1>"We Belong Together" - Mariah Carey</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p class="section-title">[Intro]</p>
    <p>Sweet love, yeah</p>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <p class="section-title">[Verse 1]</p>
    <p>I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so<br>
    I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go<br>
    I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish<br>
    I was lyin' to myself<br>
    I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love<br>
    Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself<br>
    Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me<br>
    But I thought I knew everything I never felt</p>
  </div>

  <div class="pre-chorus">
    <p class="section-title">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
    <p>The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice<br>
    Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice<br>
    Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side<br>
    Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chorus">
    <p class="section-title">[Chorus]</p>
    <p>When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)<br>
    It's still so hard to believe<br>
    Come back, baby, please<br>
    (Come back, come back, come back, come back)<br>
    'Cause we belong together<br>
    Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)<br>
    Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)<br>
    Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)<br>
    Oh, baby, baby, we belong together</p>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <p class="section-title">[Verse 2]</p>
    <p>I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind<br>
    Bobby Womack's on the radio<br>
    Singin' to me, "If you think you're lonely now"<br>
    Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)<br>
    I gotta change the station<br>
    So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break<br>
    And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"<br>
    And it's breakin' my heart<br>
    I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart</p>
  </div>

  <div class="pre-chorus">
    <p class="section-title">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
    <p>I'm feelin' all out of my element<br>
    Throwin' things, cryin'<br>
    Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong<br>
    The pain reflected in this song<br>
    Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside<br>
    I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)<br>
    (We belong together)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chorus">

    Come back, baby, please<br>
    (Come back, come back, come back, come back)<br>
    'Cause we belong together<br>
    Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)<br>
    Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)<br>
    Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)<br>
    Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby<br>
