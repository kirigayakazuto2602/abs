    <p>It's fine, it's cool<br>
    You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth<br>
    And guess I'm the fool<br>
    With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof</p>

    You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"</p>

    <p>You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
    Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling<br>
    You can say it's just the way you are<br>
    Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason<br>
    Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)<br>
    Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)<br>
    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>

    <p>I'm clichÃ©, who cares?<br>
    It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair<br>
    And I cry, it's not fair<br>
    I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air</p>

    <p>Ah, ah-yeah, oh<br>
    When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night<br>
    With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife<br>
    And when you think about me all of those years ago<br>
    You're standing face to face with "I told you so"<br>
    You know I hate to say, I told you so<br>
    You know I hate to say, but I told you so</p>
